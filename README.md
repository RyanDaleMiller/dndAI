# AI for Dungeons and Dragons
A pet project of combining dungeons and dragons 5th edition and an AI learning algorithms.

# ON HOLD
After doing some research about AI and machine learning I decided to look at smaller projects and building a portfolio before continuing this large of a project.

## First Steps (current steps)
* Creating the classes that are needed to represent Dungeons and Dragons game play.

Each class will represent some part of a Dungeons and Dragons game.
Right now there is just the Character, Race, Weapon, and Item classes.
Other classes to come will also be Spell, Armor, and others.
 Along with creating all the classes, making sure that they are stored in an efficient way as well allowing the Character class to be able to access the other classes.

## Second Steps

* Creating the AI class that will know the rules to Dungeons and Dragons, and then will observe/participate in game play as a way of learning how to play better

More research will go into this step. Such as what types of algorithms to use and narrowing what kind of data is needed to train the AI because Dungeons and Dragons is an abstract game.
