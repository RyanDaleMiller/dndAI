# AI for Dungeons and Dragons
A pet project of combining dungeons and dragons 5th edition and an AI learning algorithms.

## First Steps (current steps)
* Creating the classes that are needed to represent Dungeons and Dragons game play.

Each class will represent some part of a Dungeons and Dragons game.
Right now there is just the Character, Race, and Weapon classes.
Other classes to come will also be Spell, Armor, Item (with potential plans to make Weapon and Armor inherit from Item)

## Second Steps

* Creating the AI class that will know the rules to Dungeons and Dragons, and then will observe/participate in game play as a way of learning how to play better

More research will go into this step. Such as what types of algorithms to use, what kind of data is needed to train the AI as Dungeons and Dragons is an abstract game.
